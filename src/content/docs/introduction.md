### Key Features

## Who is Virex For?

Virex is built for:

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, here are a few concepts you'll encounter:

### Projects

A project is your application. It contains your code, configuration, and deployment history.

### Environments

Environments are isolated instances of your project. Most teams use staging and production environments, but you can create as many as you need.

### Deployments

A deployment is a specific version of your code running in an environment. Virex keeps a history of all deployments, making rollbacks instant.
